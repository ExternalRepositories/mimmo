mimmo is a C++ library for Manipulation and Morphing of surface/volume meshes (Open source).
The main aim of mimmo is to provide a framework of tools able to handle a tessellated geometry and quickly modify it. It relies on 
Radial Basis Function (RBF) and extended Free Form Deformation (eFFD) techniques to achieve it. 
Many efforts are spent to make mimmo a flexible platform, able to adapt to any User problem/need, and open to any customization. Its inner structure 
is made by essential executable blocks (EB), each one providing a basic feature, such as I/O handling, manipulating, selecting 
sub-portion of target geometries, etc... . Blocks are connectable between each other, so that they can describe a morphing workflow, easily
controllable by the User.

mimmo is developed and maintained by Optimad engineering srl and is being distributed 
under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3.

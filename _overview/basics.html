        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>
        <b>MiMMO</b> is a MPI/C++ library for performing morphing of survace and volume meshes.
        The aim of the project is to provide users with a ready-to-use tool for build his own 
        application code embedding objects of <b>MiMMO</b> library.
        </br>
        The package is organized as a library of blocks that can be linked and organized in an execution chain as
        in a block diagram workflow.
        </br> 
        The library provides a large set of blocks aimed to perform basic or advanced morphing of surface or volume meshes.
        An user can be develop his own blocks by easily coding new customized classes.
        </br>
        All the manipulation blocks derive by a common base class, the fundamental brick of the library : BaseManipulaiton class.
        
        </p>
        
        <h1>Features</h1>

         <p>
        The main features of <b>MiMMO</b> are the base class and the execution chain.
        </br>
        The first one is the core of the library, all the manipulation objects must derive from this base class.
        The properties and members of the base class are described in the following section.
        </br>
        The objects instantiated in a code can be insert in a container, the execution chain. This container
        allows tha automatic ordering of the objects and the managing of their relationship. This permits a straighforward
        setup and execution of the block diagram flow.
         </p>

        <h2>Base Class</h2>
        
        <p>
        BaseManipulation is the base class used to build each generic or particular manipulation object. 
        This base class has some common interface methods, as the base get/set methods. 
        The only method to be called to execute the manipulation object is the method exec() that calls 
        the pure virtual execute(). 
        Each manipulation base object has a linked geometry (a target <b>MiMMO</b> object) and 
        one or more linked manipulation objects from wich recovering/distributing relevant data 
        (as number of degrees of freedom, initial displacements or other). The exchange of such data is realized 
        through Ports (input/output link to same class objects). 
        See mimmo::pin namespace for further information about the linking procedure of BaseManipulation objects. 
        Please note, when you get a copy by deputed operators/constructors of the class, pins, parental linking as well as 
        custom input/result slots are not copied and left empty. Copy of BaseManipulation members in itself or in its derivations retains 
        only the following parameters of BaseManipulation: link to target geometry, its own name and its supported Type of Ports.

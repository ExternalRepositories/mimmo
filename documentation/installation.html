<h1>Installation</h1>

This page describes how to build and install MiMMO. It covers both the
released and the development versions.

MiMMO depends mainly on two open source tools/libraries : cmake and <a href="www.optimad.it/products/bitpit.html">bitpit</a>.
These are expected to be present on the machine on which MiMMO is being built.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>
In order to build MiMMO and bitpit library you need at least the following software:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    a standard compliant C++ compiler, tested are g++ (>= 4.4) and Clang (>= 3.4).
    Recent versions of ICC (>= 15) should work, older versions (like 14.0.3)
    are discouraged
</li>
<li>
    CMake (>= 2.8.6, preferably>= 2.8.12)
</li>
<li>
    bitpit (>= 1.2.0)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bitpit modules have additional dependencies, in order to have a list of the required
libraries and softwares, please refer to <a href="http://optimad.github.io/bitpit/documentation/installation.html">bitpit documentation<a>.
</p>

<!-- 
<p>
To take advangate of multi-processor systems, MiMMO can be compiled, optionally,
with parallel support. The parallel implementation of MiMMO uses the
Message-Passing Interface (MPI). Any MPI implemetation, either OpenMPI, LAM,
or MPICH suffice.
</p>

<h2>Download MiMMO source code</h2>

If you are trying to build a MiMMO release, download it from the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/index.html#stable">download page</a>.
For the development version, please follow the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/index.html#development">instructions</a>
for checking it out from git.

<h2>Configure MiMMO with CMake</h2>

<p>Create a build directory where MiMMO will be compiled. It is important
to point out the MiMMO needs to be always build in a separate build directory.
Do not build in the source directory.
<span class="codebox">
mkdir $HOME/projects/MiMMO-build
cd $HOME/projects/MiMMO-build
</span>
</p>

<p>Use ccmake (Curses CMake GUI) from the CMake installed location. CCMake is a
Curses based GUI for CMake. To run it go to the build directory and specify as
an argument the source directory (&lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;):
<span class="codebox">
ccmake &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;
</span>
The ccmake configuration process is an iterative process. First select settings
values and run the configuration (key c). After the configuration, new settings
may appear. Select the values for the new settings and run the configration
again. Repeat until all values are set and the generate option is available
(g key).
<p>

<p>
Some variables (advanced variables) are not visible right away. To see
advanced varables, toggle to advanced mode (t key).
</p>

<p>
To set a variable, move the cursor to the variable and press enter. If it is
a boolean (ON/OFF) it will flip the value. If it is string or file, it will
allow editing of the string. For file and directories, the &lt;tab&gt; key can
be used to complete.
</p>

<h3>MiMMO settings</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Sets the build type
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>BITPIT_DIR</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Sets the installation directory of bitpit library (<i>i.e.</i> the directory where the files for findPackage utility reside)
    </dd>

   <dt><strong>BUILD_EXAMPLES</strong></dt>
   <dd>
   Controls the examples will be build (examples can be build built if all
   MiMMO are compiled)
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>ENABLE_MPI</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Controls if MiMMO will be compiled with parallel support (not yet supported)
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2>Build MiMMO</h2>

<p>
After the configuration step, MiMMO can be build using the command:
<span class="codebox">
make
</span>
On multi-processor system (let's say two processor), compilation can be
done in parallel typing:
<span class="codebox">
make -j 2
</span>
</p>

<h2>Install MiMMO</h2>

<p>MiMMO can be installed typing:
<span class="codebox">
make install
</span>
This will install all the relevant files in directories under the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The executables are installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin
and the libraries are installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/MiMMO-${major}.${minor}.${revision}.

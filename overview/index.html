<h1>A quick look at mimmo</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<b>mimmo</b> is an open source C++ library for manipulation and morphing of surface and volume meshes.
The aim of the project is to provide users with a ready-to-use tool for build his own
application code embedding objects of <b>mimmo</b> library.
</br>
The package is organized as a library of blocks that can be linked and organized in an execution chain as
in a block diagram workflow.
</br>
The library provides a large set of blocks aimed to perform basic or advanced morphing of surface or volume meshes.
An user can be develop his own blocks by easily coding new customized classes.

<h2>Features and tools</h2>

<p>
The core of <b>mimmo</b> are the objects that allow to manage surface and volume meshes. This elements are hidden
to the user and integrated in the base classes of the library. The majority of the utilities are powered by the grid
manager utilities of <a class"bitpit" href="http://www.optimad.it/products/bitpit">bitpit</a> library.
The main features of <b>mimmo</b> are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Input/Output of various surface mesh formats:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>STL, VTU, NAS</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Input/Output of volume point cloud:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>OpenFOAM</b> points format, <b>VTU</b> points cloud
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Geometry parametrization and deformation:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Free form deformation (FFD)</b> based on <b>lattice</b> parametrization of volume with different base shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder)
            </li>
            <li>
                Space parametrization and geometry deformation based on <b>Radial Basis Function (RBF)</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Basic deformations:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rigid rotation, rigid translation, scaling, twisting, polynomial based bending, symmetric deformation
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        Basic tools for mesh <b>managing, deformation check and repair</b> :
        <ul>
            <li>
                multiple bodies manager, stitching, clipping, penetration control, bounded deformation
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

</p>


<h2>Execution Chain</h2>

<p>
By the use of <b>mimmo</b> library the objects instantiated in a code can be insert in a container, the execution chain. This container
allows the <b>automatic ordering </b> of the objects and the managing of their relationship. This permits a straighforward
setup and </b>execution</b> of the block diagram flow.

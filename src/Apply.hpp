 *
 *	\brief Apply is the class that applies the deformation resulting from a manipulation object to the geometry.
 *
 *	Apply is derived from BaseManipulation class. It uses the base member m_geometry to apply
 *	the result of the parent manipulator to the target MiMMO object.
 *	The deformation displacements have to be passed to the input member of base class through
 *	a pin linking or set by the user, i.e. one has to use setInput method to set
 *	the displacements to be applied to the geometry.
 *	After the execution of an object Apply, the original geometry will be modified.

 *
 *	\brief Chain is the class used to manage the execution chain of MiMMO objects.
 *
 *	Each object added to the chain is inserted with the correct position in the chain.
 *	An ID is assigned to a new chain and to every object in the chain, in order to give to the user a persistent
 *	information to recover or the position or the ID of the object in the chain.
 *	The execution is performed following the correct order of the object chain in order to avoid
 *	conflicts in parent/child dependencies.
 *	Loops in the chain are not allowed.
 *

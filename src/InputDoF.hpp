 *	\brief InputDoF is the class that import the initialization of the degrees of freedom.
 *
 *	InputDoF is derived from BaseManipulation class.
 *	It uses and it sets the base members m_ndeg and m_displacements.
 *	After the execution of an object InputDoF, the number of degrees of freedom and their initial
 *	displacements are set. The values can be set by the user in construction or by set methods of base class.
 *	Moreover the initial values can be read from an input file of text (ascii)
 *	by setting the related flag.

Testing of Unstructured Mesh grid manager.
testing class SHAPE methods and its set of utils:
LS_UTILS_SHAPE and PLOT_DISTANCE_SHAPE.

Test requires an input geometry (see ../data folder ) launch ./test1 -h to visualize help -->

Tree kind of test are possible:

0) class SHAPE testing;
	-> loading geometry in different formats and replot it in admissible formats.
	-> cleaning triangulation.
	-> extract marked part of surface by user of preexistent PID.

1) LS_UTILS_SHAPE methods:	
	-> generate Volumetric Level set of Open Surfaces / Closed Surfaces.
2) PLOT_DISTANCE_SHAPE	
	-> generate tabular xyz field of signed distance of a Closed surface.
